# redo the analysis of Differential expression between primary and met with batch4 data added.
The comparison between primary and met are performed pairwise for each patient(,and controlled by sequening batches?).
Sample information are in the sampleInfo.csv file. (one sample data are merged between batches)

## Perform alignment and genecount to hg19 for each batch
source 20180903.Batch4.sh

## combine batch2, batch3, batch4
- mergedSampleInfo:keep the merged sample (exclude the original two samples)
    - add metaTissue column
- mergedGeneCount: merge M1_016 and M9_018
    - rename and aligned to sampleInfo
